          Full-Stack Software Engineer using a background in teaching and
          construction to build intuitive apps and break down complex problems
          into manageable tasks utilizing iterative development methodology.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Recently, I earned a certificate in Full-Stack Web Development from
          the University of Denver, gaining skills in JavaScript,
          object-oriented programming, MySQL, NodeJS, and Bootstrap. I was able
          to excel in the fast paced environment due to my prior work
          experience, collaborating with dynamic teams and helping motivate and
          support my classmates.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          During my first month in the program, working as part of a team, I
          created, developed, and deployed an app called BeerMe. It received
          positive feedback both from peers and instructors, both for the
          usefulness of the concept as well as for functionality. During the
          project, I incorporated a language translator API and debugged other
          problematic external API calls. In my second month, I was responsible
          for creating the Handlebars Layout for another project as well as
          debugging and acting as the teamâ€™s Scrum-Master.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Using what I already know about creative problem solving, forward
          thinking, and cross-functional collaboration will allow me to develop
          applications that fulfill client needs. I am excited to use my newly
          gained and existing skills as a Software Engineer!
